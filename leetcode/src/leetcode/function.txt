Queue queue = new LinkedList();

Arrays (Operate on primitive array)
This class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as sorting and searching). 
This class also contains a static factory that allows arrays to be viewed as lists.
Arrays.sort(T[] arr)
Arrays.copyOf(T[] arr, int newLength) / Arrays.copyOf(T[] arr, int from, int to)

Collections (Operate on collections such as list)

Collections.copy() / new ArrayList(int capacity);
That's a very good question and it almost certainly has to do with the fact 
that setting a collections capacity does not necessarily allocate the underlying objects

char/Character


String s
s.length()/s.substring(int begin, int end)
